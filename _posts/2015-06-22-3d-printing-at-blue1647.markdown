Every visit to BLUE1647 is full of pleasant surprises. Thereâ€™s new equipment, a new opportunity to learn new technology, new people to learn from, or all of the above.

I recently bought a second [Parallella](/blog/2015/05/27/massively-parallel-parallella/) for a WisdomGroup project. Since it's important to protect the device with a case, this seemed like a good time to try 3D printing. The result is in the photo, above.

### Why 3D Printing Matters
The current state of 3D printing feels like laser printing in the 1980s. Laser printers were big and expensive. Shareing the printer among many users made the cost easier to justify. 3D printers are in a similar position in the year 2015. And, as with any new technology, prices for 3D printers are on a downward slope. 

The 3D printers at BLUE1647 are available to any member. Talk to [Rashad Glover](http://www.rashadglover.com/) or [Patrick Harris](http://imagine-it-tech.com/) to get started.

### What to Know about 3D Printing
First: It takes a _long_ time. The case in the photo took 

Grabbed two STL files (one top, one bottom) from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:273701/#files
